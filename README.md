# Hello-World
Github Introduction

#Hey everyone,

#I am a biochemist with interest in bioinformatics. I have been teaching myself python, bash, and R so that I may develop my skills as I move forward with my educational endeavors.
#My degree was focused on biochemistry and biophysics. I have hands-on research and industry experience in polymers, proteins, iridium catalysts, computational modeling, and a wide variety of analytical instrumentation.

#My goal here is to practice my coding skills by building simple games, applications, and eventually systems that are useful in the realm of bioinformatics.

#Thanks for reading my GitHub,
#Brandon
